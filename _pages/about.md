Hey there! I'm Mona. I'm just starting my Ph.D. adventure in the world of Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University. Right now, I'm currently knee-deep in this awesome project with Gallo ORACL, and I've got the super-awesome [Professor Tefagh]([http://sharif.edu/~mtefagh/index.html](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shmoys/) as my guide.

Before this academic adventure, I spent a year as a scientific intern at IST Austria, working alongside the brilliant minds of [Professor Chatterjee](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/chatterjee-group/)'s group.

Back in my Sharif University days, I had the honor of teaming up with [Professor Tefagh](http://sharif.edu/~mtefagh/index.html).

Check out my website to get the lowdown on my academic journey and experiences! ðŸš€ðŸ˜Ž


Research
======
I'm passionate about delving into the dynamic world where Computer Science and Economics meet, and that's where Operations Research (OR) takes the spotlight. My focus? Harnessing the power of math and algorithms to craft smart solutions, especially in areas like Optimization, Revenue Management, and Mechanism Design. My Ph.D. journey has just begun, and I'm genuinely excited by the incredible research happening here, perfectly aligned with my interests. I'm eager to dive deeper into these fields and explore further. <br>
So far I have worked on:
* Prophet Inequality
* Spectral Graph Theory
* Mechanism Design in Bitcoin

News
======
* Aug 21 : I am excited to announce my enrollment in the renowned Cornell University Operations Research and Industrial Engineering (ORIE) program, where I will be pursuing my Ph.D. journey.
* Aug 7 : I am thrilled to announce the publication of our collaborative work with Professor Abiad Monge in the esteemed journal Discrete Applied Mathematics.
