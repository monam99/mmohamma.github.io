Hey! I am Mona, a senior bachelor's student of computer science and economics at the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. Previously I was a scientific intern at IST Austria, working in Professor Chatterjee's amazing group on Prophet Inequality for a year. Besides my academic career, I do enjoy traveling, photography, and fitness. 

Research
======
My primary research interests lie in the intersection of Computer Science and Economics. In particular, I am interested in using mathematical and algorithmic methods to provide approximately efficient solutions in fields including Matching Theory, Game Theory, and Mechanism Design, especially under uncertainty and where incomplete information, agentsâ€™ incentives, and computational complexity need to be considered. 

News
======
I am going to give a talk about _Economics & Computation_ virtually on **22th of December** at _the Sharif University of Technology_ (in Persian). Write me if you are interested in attending.
