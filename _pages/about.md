Hey! I am Mona, a senior bachelor's student of Computer Science and Economics at the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. Previously I was a scientific intern at IST Austria, working in [Professor Chatterjee](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/chatterjee-group/)'s amazing group for a year. At Sharif, I have a privilege to work with [Professor Tefagh](http://sharif.edu/~mtefagh/index.html). Besides my academic career, I do enjoy traveling, photography, and fitness. 

Research
======
My primary research interests lie in the intersection of Computer Science and Economics. In particular, I am interested in using mathematical and algorithmic methods to provide approximately efficient solutions in fields including _Matching Theory_, _Game Theory_, and _Mechanism Design_, especially under uncertainty and where incomplete information, agentsâ€™ incentives, and computational complexity need to be considered. <br>
So far I have worked on:
* Prophet Inequality
* Spectral Graph Theory
* Mechanism Design in Bitcoin

News
======
* Dec 22 : I am going to give a talk about _Economics & Computation_ at _the Sharif University of Technology_ virtually in Persian . Write me an email if you are interested in attending.
