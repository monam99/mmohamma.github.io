Hey there! I'm Mona. I'm just starting my Ph.D. adventure in the world of Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University. Right now, I'm currently knee-deep in this awesome project with Gallo ORACL, and I've got the super-awesome [Professor Tefagh]([http://sharif.edu/~mtefagh/index.html](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shmoys/) as my guide.

Before this academic adventure, I spent a year as a scientific intern at IST Austria, working alongside the brilliant minds of [Professor Chatterjee](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/chatterjee-group/)'s group.

Back in my Sharif University days, I had the honor of teaming up with [Professor Tefagh](http://sharif.edu/~mtefagh/index.html).

Check out my website to get the lowdown on my academic journey and experiences! ðŸš€ðŸ˜Ž


Research
======
My primary research interests lie in the intersection of Computer Science and Economics. In particular, I am interested in using mathematical and algorithmic methods to provide approximately efficient solutions in fields including _Matching Theory_, _Game Theory_, and _Mechanism Design_, especially under uncertainty and where incomplete information, agentsâ€™ incentives, and computational complexity need to be considered. <br>
So far I have worked on:
* Prophet Inequality
* Spectral Graph Theory
* Mechanism Design in Bitcoin

News
======
* Aug 21 : I am excited to announce my enrollment in the renowned Cornell University Operations Research and Industrial Engineering (ORIE) program, where I will be pursuing my Ph.D. journey.
* Aug 7 : I am thrilled to announce the publication of our collaborative work with Professor Abiad Monge in the esteemed journal Discrete Applied Mathematics.
